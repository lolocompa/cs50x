#### Video Demo:  <URL https://youtu.be/Vr-IfIpokSs>
#### Description: A web page that allows you to filter movies by your preference, using the movies database provided in pset 7 the user can filter movies by released year, mínimum rating, 2 actors and a director, you also can add the movies that you like to a list of films to watch, you can modify this list by adding or removing ítems from this list.it also comes with a register and login. i came up with this idea because i love movies and sometimes i dont have any idea of what to watch, so i thought that a movie recomendation website could be pretty usefull for people like me, i know is not the best design but its a start and im very proud of it. some aspects that i would like to improve is that i used the database that cs50 provided in week 7 for the lab on movies because i didnt know how to search and use one from the internet that would have made my website so much better designed, thats why i couldnt add more parameters to the site like genres and whatnot, so i think that is a thing i must improve in the future. in the app.py first i defined the /register route which i imported from the previus pset as well as the login and logut routes, next i defined the / route which when requested with get it displays the user a form to pass the parameters for filtering films, once the user submits the parameters and the route is rquested by a post, it querys through the movies database filtering films by the users parameters, next i render a template called list.html handling the resulting table wich will diplay a list of movies that matches the users preferences. in the list.html the user can click on the titles wich will redirect to google search and it also can add it to a list
